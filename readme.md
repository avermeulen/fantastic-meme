# How to change CSS from the back-end

This is an example of a project of how to trigger a change in your front-end from the back-end using `socket.io`.

It's using socket.io (in `server.js`) to send trigger an event called `change` from the back-end using `setInterval` every 2 seconds. It use a counter to determine what value to send to the client.

The client side (in `client.js`) code is listening for the `change` event using:

```javascript
io.on('change', function(data) {
    // data contains info sent from the server side
    // this can now be used with the DOM
})
```
